I took the following genomic sequences
S0 = 'ACTTGTCGGATGATCAGCGGTCCATGCACCTGACAACGGT'
S1 = 'ACATGTTGCTTGACGACAGGTCCATGCGCCTGAGAACGGC'
(a)
I ran the code over 10000 iterations and the value
tends towards a value close to the eigenvector of
M with eigenvalue 1
(b)
Using a computer we get the following eigenvalues
1.0000      
0.4690    
0.6357  
0.7943
Yes 1 is an eigen value and the vector I get in part a
is close to the eigenvector with a RMSE (Root mean sqaure error)
of 4.1956e-16
I'm getting 
0.1846
0.3949
0.2821
0.1385
vs the vector
0.1846
0.3949
0.2821
0.1385
(c)
Theorem. A Markov matrix always has λ1 = 1 as its largest eigenvalue and
has all eigenvalues satisfying |λ| ≤ 1.The eigenvector corresponding to λ1
has all nonnegative entries
We can clearly see that among all eigenvalues, 1 is the largest eigenvalue
The eigenvector corresponding to it is:
0.1846
0.3949
0.2821
0.1385

Theorem. A Markov matrix, all of whose entries are positive (i.e., nonzero),
always has 1 as a strictly dominant eigenvalue.There will be only one eigenvector (up to scalar multiplication) associated with λ = 1

This is also true, as 
taking the following markov matrix
  	0.9000    0.0345    0.0273    0.0194
    0.0300    0.9080    0.0727    0.0194
    0.0200    0.0460    0.8727    0.0485
    0.0500    0.0115    0.0273    0.9126
This has the following eigenvalues
	1.0000 + 0.0000i
   	0.8847 + 0.0142i
   	0.8847 - 0.0142i
   	0.8239 + 0.0000i
There is only one eigenvalue 1 and only one eigenvector corresponding to it
	
    0.2170
    0.3081
    0.2364
    0.2385
